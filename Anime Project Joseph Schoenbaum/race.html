    <h2>Black representation in Anime</h2>
    <pre align="center">
        Japanese animation has been around for many decades dating back to the 1960s ands 1970s. A lot of ideas 
        Japanese animators got came from American animation back in the 1940s and 1950s. In a lot of early American animation
        black people are painted in a negative manner. To add on top of this, Japan is a homogenous country with 98.5% of its 
        population being Japanese. Due to this, there is extremely poor representation for other races, in particular black people. 
        Still, there is no excuse for not giving black characters a fairer role in their animes.</pre>

    <ul id="attractList">
        <li><div><a href='javascript:void()' onClick="showStuff1()"><img src="images/popojinx.jpg"></a></div>
            <div id="hidden1" style="display: none"><p>While One piece and Pokemon are decades old, they are still two of the most
                popular animes of all time. The two characters of Jinx and Mr.Popo show black people in a very racist manner by the
                way they were illustrated. It shows a lack of understanding of black people from the Japanese animators to draw these
                characters in a "golliwog-like" manner.
            </p></div>
        </li>

        <li><div><a href='javascript:void()' onClick="showStuff2()"><img src="images/bee.gif"></a></div>
            <div id="hidden2" style="display: none"><p>Naruto does a great job building out the world throughout the anime. In this world
                building the audience comes across the hidden cloud village which a village of mainly black people. The main character from this
                village is Killer Bee. All his lines are rap verses. He rarely speaks when he is not rapping. Again, this shows a lack of
                understanding by the Japanese animators. All they know of black people is from American culture where they 
                popularized hip hop and rap.
            </p></div>
        </li>

        <li><div><a href='javascript:void()' onClick="showStuff3()"><img src="images/canary.jpg"></a></div>
            <div id="hidden3" style="display: none"><p>In Hunter X Hunter, a black character Canary plays a supporting role. She
                is the bodygaurd to one of the main character's family never disobeying an order. In the entire show there is always
                a sense that she is a step below the family, at one point even being knocked uncounscious for failing to live up to the
                mother of the family's orders. Having a black character in this type of role shows how American culture has impacted anime.
            </p></div>
        </li>

        <li><div><a href='javascript:void()' onClick="showStuff4()"><img src="images/aran.png"></a></div>
            <div id="hidden4" style="display: none"><p>Aran Ojiro is the only black supporting character in the anime Haikyu. 
                He is known for his athletic ability and extremely strong spikes, but his weakness is lack of mental fortitude when
                the other team attacks him. This is another common stereotype of the strong tall black athlete from American culture. 
            </p></div>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <pre align="center">While I'm not trying to say these stereotypes are an abomination, they definetly show a lack of understanding
        from the Japanese community of black people. Anime needs to do a better job giving black people various types of roles and platforms
        within anime. Shows such as Carole & Tuesday do a great job of this. Anime has a large black community with shows like Boondocks
        being inspired by Japanese animation. To further grow and support this community black anime characters need to have more important
        roles. This video shows a lot of great examples of how anime poorly portrays black people.
