    <h2>Gender in Anime</h2>
    <pre align="center">In the United States we may not do the greatest job at gender equality, but it is a large topic of conversation.
        Japan ranks fourth lowest in gender equality out of the 51 highest developed countries. This has caused anime to follow very 
        structured gender roles, not to mention a severe lack in characters exploring sexuality or gender identity. In
        Japan these topics are rarely, if ever, discussed. I will try to share more information about gender in anime.

    <ul id="attractList">
        <li><div><a href='javascript:void()' onClick="showStuff1()"><img src="images/ruka2.gif"></a></div>
            <div id="hidden1" style="display: none"><p>One of the only examples I've seen in anime of a transgender character is in
                Steins Gate. Ruka Urushibara is a transgender woman. In the show interactions with Ruka are always awkward or odd, and the show
                makes a point to have their characters confused by Ruka's gender. While it's great that this show even has transgender representation,
                they do a poor job making Ruka a contributing part of the story. She is often only brought into the story to bring up her gender.
            </p></div>
        </li>

        <li><div><a href='javascript:void()' onClick="showStuff2()"><img src="images/sakura.jpg"></a></div>
            <div id="hidden2" style="display: none"><p>If you've seen Naruto, you've heard the jokes about how weak Sakura is. Sakura is the main female
                character in Naruto. She is part of Naruto's 3 man team of her, Naruto, and Sasuke. While Naruto and Sasuke are basically gods by
                the end of the show, Sakura is only known for healing them (a stereotypical skill of women) and having a crush on Sasuke. This 
                is a perfect example of how anime represents women, not giving them any space to compete with their male counter parts.
            </p></div>
        </li>

        <li><div><a href='javascript:void()' onClick="showStuff3()"><img src="images/haku.gif"></a></div>
            <div id="hidden3" style="display: none"><p>On a contrarian note, many male characters in anime are illustrated in a feminine light.
                The character in the picture is Haku, a male character in Naruto. There are various examples of this within anime. This could be
                seen in similar light to how in K-Pop many male artists lean on feminine characteristics. It's very interesting and frustrating that
                they allow male characters to explore their roles, while females characters are locked into theirs.
            </p></div>
        </li>

        <li><div><a href='javascript:void()' onClick="showStuff4()"><img src="images/misa.gif"></a></div>
            <div id="hidden4" style="display: none"><p>Another very popular stereotypical role for female characters in anime is the 
                crazy girl. The girl in the gif above is Misa from Death Note. She is willing to kill anybody who threatens the main
                character, L. Other examples of overly crazy female characters include Hange Zoe from Attack on Titan, Nina Einstein 
                from Code Geass, and Himiko Toga from My Hero Academia.
            </p></div>
        </li>

    </ul>

    <pre align="center">Japanese anime needs to further explore gender roles, indentity, and sexuality. It's hard to see when that progress
        will come due to Japanese very conservative culture. Hopefully, in time, anime can give more female characters empowering roles. If
        you want to further learn about the sexualization and representation of female characters in anime watch the video below!
