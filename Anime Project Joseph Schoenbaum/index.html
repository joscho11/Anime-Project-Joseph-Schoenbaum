<pre class="center">
    Anime is defined as hand-drawn or computer animation originating from Japan. In recent 
    years, anime has grown to become a very popular form of media worldwide, especially with 
    younger generations. In fact, Demon Slayer: Mugen Train was the highest-grossing film of 2020 
    bringing in 494.5 million USD. Anime is a very large industry and I will be generalizing throughout 
    this website, nonetheless, it's very important to point out places where Japanese animators need to be better. 
    Anime has some wonderful qualities to it, like mind-blowing animation and plot-twisting stories, but there 
    many concerns as well. Hopefully, by shining light on these issues, we can bring more awareness to problems 
    within anime, such as hypersexualizing female characters, stagnant race/gender stereotypes, 
    and lack of shows exploring gender and sexuality.</pre>
