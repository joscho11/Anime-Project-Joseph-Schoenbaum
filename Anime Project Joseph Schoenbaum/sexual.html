    <h2>Hypersexualizing Female Characters</h2>
    <pre align="center">
        While in recent decades Japan has made major strides towards gender equality, Japan is a society heavily catered towards males.
        Anime began as a form of entertainment produced and managed mainly by men and consumed by mostly men. This has caused the
        male gaze to have a tremendous impact on the way female characters are portrayed in anime.</pre> 

    <h1>Exploring the Issue</h1>

    <ul id="attractList">
        <li><div><a href='javascript:void()' onClick="showStuff1()"><img src="images/nami.jpg"></a></div>
            <div id="hidden1" style="display: none"><p>
                One piece is arguably the most popular and successful anime of all time. The main female protagonist 
                Nami is a perfect example of how anime has over sexualized women to attract male viewers.
                One piece is a shonen anime. A shonen anime is targeted towards teenage boys, and its one of
                the more popular types of anime. Besides One Piece, some examples include Naruto, Bleach, and Dragon Ball Z.
            </p></div>
        </li>

        <li><div><a href='javascript:void()' onClick="showStuff2()"><img src="images/konosuba.gif"></a></div>
            <div id="hidden2" style="display: none"><p>
                Konosuba is one of the worst culprits regarding this issue. It revolves around one male protagonist 
                with three hypersexualized female characters. As the gif shows, these younger looking female characters
                are shown in an inappropriate sexualized manner. This is a common occurrence is many anime throughout the industry.
            </p></div>
        </li>

        <li><div><a href='javascript:void()' onClick="showStuff3()"><img src="images/kill.gif"></a></div>
            <div id="hidden3" style="display: none"><p>Kill la Kill shows just how disturbing anime creators can be. 
                It shows underage female characters still in school in an extremely over sexualized manner. There is absolutely no reason
                to show a their characters in this type of clothing. On top of that everytime they transform into their costume they are 
                over sexualized in an extreme manner
            </p></div>
        </li>

        <li><div><a href='javascript:void()' onClick="showStuff4()"><img src="images/midnight2.png"></a></div>
            <div id="hidden4" style="display: none"><p>
                Midnight is another example in a shonen anime of how women are objectified. The clothing is a great 
                example of how women are forced to where extremely sexual clothing, contrary to the male characters. 
                This is similar to how female characters in video games have provocative clothing to induce the male gaze.
            </p></div>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <pre align="center">
        It is not all bad though! Plenty of Anime do a great job giving female characters a meaningful role.
